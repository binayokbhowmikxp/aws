Methods For Encrypting Application Data
There are multiple strategies for ensuring that data processed and generated by an application ends up in an encrypted state on disk.

Applications and underlying infrastructure services will leverage the following concepts:

Key Management Service and Encryption Keys
Refer to a key management service to determine which encryption key will be used to encrypt the data.

AWS provides a key management service called KMS which is tightly integrated with the AWS services and the AWS SDKs that a developer would be using.

Client-Side Encryption
You can choose to encrypt the data within the application prior to persisting or writing. We will loosely refer to this as client-side encryption.

Server-Side or AWS Service native encryption
Alternatively, have the AWS service handle the underlying encryption activities. We can refer to this broadly as server-side encryption.
